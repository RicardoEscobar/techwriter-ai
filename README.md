# Tech writer AI

This is a tool using AI to write technical documentation for data definition language code for SQL Server stored procedures.

The tool reads a source code file and provides documentation in the form of:

- A header comment containing a description of the script file, a list of arguments and their description.
- A comment before SELECT queries describing what they do in a general, human readeable manner.
